# Olink
My workflows to analyze Olink data.

TODO
1st project:

  
  INITIATION
- Sort data: create broad experiment labels for each sample ✅
- Write script to upload data ✅
- Reinvent sorting/cutting off subsets from data ✅
- Script to do a PCA for a subset ✅
- Script to do boxplots for targets from subplot PCAs ✅
  
  PROPAGATION
- ANOVA and Posthoc analysis: can do for all/some (pre-filter by subsets) datasets and plot boxplots with posthoc ***

   
  TERMINATION
- PCA for each experiment -> pick relevant proteins
- Heatmap for experiments/whole dataset -> pick relevant proteins
- Boxplots for relevant proteins f/ each experiment

  
2nd project:
- Pre-sort the data: creat labels
- Heatmap proteins
- Subset the data
- Compare dilution series
- Compare pre- vs post-op
- Compare UP in pre- with interst. cancerv NOT UP with distal normal (PCA?)
